## Usage
This crate simply appends to your `.bash_profile`.
It will create a `.bash_profile` file if one is not
found in your home directory.
`ie. /Users/me/.bash_profile`.

I have only tested this on macOS but it should
work on any unix system. I want to add windows 
support soon.

Contributions are welcome.
