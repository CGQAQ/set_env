## Usage
This crate simply appends to your `.profile` and 
if it can't find that it will try `.bash_profile`. 
It will not create any files so you may need to
create one of those files in your home directory
`ie. /Users/me/.profile`.

I have only tested this on macOS but it should
work on any unix system. I want to add windows 
support soon.

Contributions are welcome.
